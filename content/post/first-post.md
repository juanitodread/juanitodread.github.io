Well these are my first steps with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/). I really like how **hugo** is designed and how you have to work with it.

I have an old blog with Blogger but at this point I decided to use *github pages* and work with hugo to generate static content like this ;).

Iâ€™m still learning hugo due today I just know the basics *(really basics)* steps in hugo.

I hope add more and more content to this blog. My idea is to write about software development and share a lot of my knowledge. My next steps are:

* Enable comments
* Start my resume

And here we have a bit of code :D

```
// Hello world in Scala

object Main {
  def main(args: Array[String]): Unit = {
    println("Hello world!!!... and welcome to this blog ;)")
  }
}
```
